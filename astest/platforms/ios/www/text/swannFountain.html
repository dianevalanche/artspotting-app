<p>There are tons of fountains in Philadelphia. So many, that there is a Philadelphia Fountain Society. The Philadelphia Fountain Society was founded by one Dr. Wilson Cary Swann. In the early 1920s, a great fountain was created in Logan Square and named after Dr. Swann, who died in 1876. The Swann Fountain was the result of collaboration between architect Wilson Eyre, Jr. and sculptor Alexander Stirling Calder.</p>

<p>Alexander Stirling’s father (Alexander Milne Calder) was a sculptor too (he sculpted the enormous statue of William Penn atop City Hall), and was himself the son of a tombstone carver. Alexander Stirling’s son was a famous sculptor (also called Alexander) and the artist people usually think of when they hear the name “Calder.” The youngest Calder made all those mobiles with black and red shapes you’ve seen at modern art museums around the world. Now that we’ve sorted out the Calders, what about the Swann Fountain?</p>

<p>The Swann Fountain consists of three human figures lounging around a central spout. One figure is a Native American man grabbing at a fish above his head—he represents the Delaware River. A woman lying on her back represents the Schuylkill River. And a young girl on her side represents the Wissahickon Creek. Both women rest their heads against swans. Further out from these figures are a number of turtles and frogs, spitting water back at the center of the fountain.</p>

<p>It is often remarked that there is quite a lot of playfulness in the Swann Fountain, what with the fish-grabbing and swan-reclining and frog-spitting. I think the statue is more than playful; it is downright funny. Look at it again next time you’re around Logan Square. The Wissahickon girl is really chucking her shoulder into that swan. He spouts his water accordingly. The Schuylkill lady is practically throttling her swan. Who can say what the fish is doing above Delaware River Man?</p>

<p>This brings up a classic problem facing any sculptor working with fountains. How do you get those two things together, water and sculpture? Sculptors have dealt with this problem in different ways. Nicola Salvi designed the Trevi Fountain in Rome, for instance, as a scene with gods and animals at the font of a river. The water isn’t doing anything spectacular, it is just flowing out as water normally does at the source of a river. The Trevi was built in the 18th century. But as the technology for fountains advanced, it became possible to shoot water out of various jets and spouts. This was great — everyone loves shooting water — but problematic in narrative terms. Why are all these people and animals shooting water around anyway?</p>

<p>Alexander Stirling Calder, to his great credit, decided that it simply didn’t matter. He decided to celebrate the essentially hilarious proposition of people and animals shooting water out of their mouths. Calder’s Swann Fountain is an elegant and pleasing scenario that makes no great sense. The water shooting out of the sculptures is absurd but delightful. It is no surprise that Alexander Stirling Calder’s son ended up being the sculptor fascinated with childish subject matter like mobiles and circuses. Art, the Calders thought, is generated of the same impulses that make a child laugh. So, take a trip to the center of Philadelphia and spend some time with a truly hilarious sculpture.</p>
