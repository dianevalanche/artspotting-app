<p>After you visit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and think about all the corpses under Washington Square, it’s time to visit the Moon Tree. “What’s a Moon Tree?” you ask. Well, a Moon Tree is a tree that, as a seed, was in orbit around the moon. This happened in 1971, during the Apollo 14 mission. Astronaut Stuart Roosa had worked as a “smoke jumper” (a guy who parachutes in to fight wild fires) for the US Forest Service. So, when Roosa was picked as an astronaut for Apollo 14, the Forest Service asked him to take five hundred tree seeds into orbit around the moon. The idea was to see if being in space would have any effect on the normal growth cycle of the seeds. Upon return, the seeds were distributed to parks and public sites all around the country to be planted.</p>

<p>One sycamore seed ended up in Philadelphia and was planted in Washington Square on May 6th, 1975 as part of the Bicentennial celebrations. The seed did pretty well, growing into a mid-sized sycamore over the years. Then, a few years ago, it started to die. Maybe being planted in the soil with all those dead bodies shortened its life span. By 2008, the Moon Tree was certifiably dead. But despair not! The scientists had one more trick up their sleeves. Folks from the Morris Arboretum took cuttings from the tree before it died. They cloned Moon Tree. On September 24, 2011, there was an official ceremony to cut down the dead Moon Tree and plant the new sapling cloned from its branches. The new Moon Tree is now doubly freakish. It is a clone from space.</p>

<p>Let’s go back once more to the scientific purpose of Moon Trees. Thanks to all the Moon Trees, we now know that seeds taken into space sprout normally. There is some scientific value to this information, probably. But not that much. The whole stunt was as much a public relations campaign as it was a genuine “experiment.” Let’s remember that public enthusiasm for the Apollo missions was in steep decline by the time of Apollo 14. In a sense, Stuart Roosa took seeds into space because it was a fun idea. And planting Moon Trees was a fun idea too. It is something you can imagine a contemporary artist doing and then calling it an “installation.” Indeed, you may not have heard of it, but there is an entire category of contemporary art known as BioArt, where artists experiment with living organisms and life processes. So, you can think of Moon Tree, Philadelphia as one of the first works of BioArt.</p>

<p>The art project known as Moon Tree continues to grow and change. It is a living part of the city of Philadelphia. Go and check it out some day when you are in the neighborhood. It’s not every day that you get to spend time with a clone that landed on earth from outer space.</p>
